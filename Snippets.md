### *Explanation:*

``remote`` refers to the hosted repository. ``origin`` is the pointer to where that ``remote`` is. Most of the time, ``origin`` is the only pointer there is on a local repository.

If you want to change the pointing URL attached to ``origin``, you can remove the existing ``origin`` and then add it back in again with the correct URL.
To remove your handler, use the remove command on ``remote``, followed by the handler name â€“ which, in our case, is ``origin``.

### *Snippet:*

    git remote remove origin
